Instagram Challenge
===================

User stories for Instagram:

```
As a user
So that I can have an account
I would like to be able sign up to Instagram
```
```
As a user
So that I can use Instagram
I would like to be able to post pictures
```
```
As a user
So that I can comment on photos
I would like to be able to comment on photos
```
```
As a user
So that I can show love for a photo
I would like to be able to like photos
```

















Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

## How to start

1. Produce some stories, break them down into tasks, and estimate
2. Fork this repo, clone, etc
3. Initialize a new rails project

Remember to proceed in small steps! Getting confused? Make the steps even smaller.

## Code Quality

For linting, you can use the `.rubocop.yml` in this repository (or your own!).
You'll need these gems:

```ruby
gem "rubocop", "0.48.1"
gem "rubocop-rails"
```

You can also lint Javascript, CSS, and ERB — feel free to research this. These
will help you to train yourself to produce cleaner code — and will often alert
you to mistakes or mishaps!
